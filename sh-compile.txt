The program was tested (compiled) using Developer Command Prompt for VS2017.

First the source code needs to be compiled using : "cl /c compilare1a.cpp Person.cpp". 

Then the .obj filles need to be linked: "link compilare1a.obj Person.obj"

This will result in an executable file which can be used to run the program.
